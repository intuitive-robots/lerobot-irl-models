# Pi0 policy configuration
# @package _global_.policy

# Policy type - must be "pi0" for LeRobot's Pi0 implementation
type: pi0

# Pretrained model path - use one of:
# - lerobot/pi0_base (base model)
# - lerobot/pi0_libero (trained on Libero dataset)
# - or path to your own checkpoint

# Model compilation for faster training (recommended)
compile_model: true

# Gradient checkpointing to reduce memory usage
gradient_checkpointing: true

# Data type for training (bfloat16 for mixed precision)
dtype: bfloat16

# Device
device: cuda

# Optional: specific configuration overrides
# action_dim: 8  # Will be inferred from dataset
